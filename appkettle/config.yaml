name: AppKettle
description: "A small addon which allows you to control your AppKettle through Home Assistant. Important note: you must block internet access for your AppKettle to force it into local mode. This can be done in several ways, including using a firewall or a router. If you do not block internet access, the kettle will not permit local connections and will not be able to be controlled."
